If you have ever been in one of those standups, you know what I mean. 
Everyone following the "what I did, what I plan to do, any blockers" pattern without actually paying attention to what others said. <br/>
And then standup is over and everyone walks away not even remembering what was said...



This is wrong kind of standup.
Probably if you asked the attendees why are they doing it they would look at you funny and say 'we do scrum', shrugging.


The true value of daily standup is to determine how close the team has gotten to the sprint goal and to plan actions for the upcoming 24 hours. Then, on the next standup, we inspect what has been done, and adapt to ensure that we can achieve sprint goal.
If you don't use your standup for inspection and adaptation, you might as well skip it, it will bring no value.

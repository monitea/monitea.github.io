Are you a tester or a QA?

This seemingly simple question is not as simple as you might think.
Be careful!
Your answer will determine how you see your role and where you see your place in whole delivery process.

Let's take a look:

## "I'm a tester!"

What you just said is: _"I work with product. I detect problems. I make sure we did the right thing."_
Your product might be a piece of software, car part, gathered fruit or anything that is said to be finished.

In traditional processes, by the time the product reaches you, it has already gone through all other stages.
In lean / agile you might have to deal with smaller pieces of the product more often and you might be able to know product requirements earlier, but it still boils down to validation of the product itself.

You have a **"thing"** and you _validate it_ against stakeholder needs, represented by requirements.
You come up with different ways to test the product to find any issues it might have before it leaves production. This is a lot of work and takes lots of expertise.

You are answering questions like. _"Does it do what it was supposed to do?"_ or _"Does it have required properties?"_
You enter late in the process, to provide feedback about the quality of the **"thing"** at hand.
When you say "I found no major issues" people will trust that the product at hand meets requirements and is safe for use.

_**Be proud**_
_As a tester, you are a final line of defense. You catch bugs before they make it to production._

## "I'm a QA!"

What you just said is: _"I work with processes. I prevent problems. I make sure that we are doing our thing right."_

Your role is to make sure that project / product is set up for success.
When you start your work, the **"thing"** is not there yet. It might not even be designed. It will probably be a brain child of some main stakeholder. Your task is to make sure that all steps of development process align in order to _prevent_ issues. 

It might mean having a requirements review. Or teaching team members about test design techniques. It will most likely mean preaching about quality wherever you are.

As a QA, you deal with questions like _"How do we know requirement is ready to be implemented?"_ or _"What should our testing strategy be?"_ or _"Which types of tests should be executed and which can be safely omitted given our timeline?"_ or _"How do we know our investment in testing pays off?"_

Testing is part of what you are interested in. This is how you know that processes you put in place are effective, but most of your work happens much earlier. Few issues found in testing indicate you did your job right.

_**Be proud**_
_As a QA, you make life for everyone in your project easier, because they do not have to deal with buggy product._**


## Which one is better?

Neither. Testing is part of Quality Assurance for the project. You try to do the right thing and you try to do it right. Both must work together - otherwise you will find yourself knee deep in trouble.

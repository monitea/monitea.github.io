I recently started scrum mastering for a newly built team.
Several initial standups were held according to "what I did - what I plan to do - what blocks me".
And you know what?
Those standups sucked.

I did not have any sense of where we are with the sprint, I could not tell if we were on the right track...

I proposed a change of approach. 
I suggested we hold our standup constantly looking at our sprint dashboard and focus not on people, but on actual stories within the sprint.

For me, this approach felt much better.
We'll see what the team says on the retrospective...

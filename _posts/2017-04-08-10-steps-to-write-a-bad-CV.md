You can find many guides on how to write a good CV. 
That's boring. 
Let's write the worst CV possible together!

# Background

I have been involved in my company's hiring process for quite a few years now.
I have seen many CVs. Some good, some worse, some horrible.
I had the "pleasure" of browsing through many more of those than I would ever like to.
Want to see some examples?
Let's start!

# 1. Don't give your education information!

Especially for students:
Let's play hide and seek with the recruiter and test their glass ball!
Never, ever disclose any educational information about yourself.
If you do, make sure for it to be irrelevant and incomplete.
Secrecy first!

# 2. Education: gotta catch them all!

If you don't like the first idea, put it ALL in! 
Primary school? Check!
Secondary school? Check!
Additional chef course while applying for IT position? But of course!
A-training-that-I-went-to-years-ago-and-got-certificate-but-remember-nothing? Put it in!

If you can't hide it, you need to confuse the enemy with abundance of information.

# 3. Employment history: that's confidential!

So... you're writing a CV, so you must disclose something about yourself. 
You can put in employment dates and position. If you're feeling generous, you can even put in company name!

But don't you ever, ever, write anything about your responsibilities. 
You managed a team of people? Hush! They might see you as a leader, brrr!
You were in touch with customers? Shhh, they may want you to do it again!

Or if you do mention your responsibilities, make them extra generic.
Good example? "Responsible for writing Java code"

In general: the shorter and more cryptic, the better. If you can't keep it short for any reason, be confusing!

# 4. Skills list: pump that sucker!

If you heard about WhateverJS, in it goes! 
Your colleague configured application server and you watched him work for 5 minutes? Yay, another thing to add!
You soldered something years ago? Of course it counts!
You got a D+ in Lisp on your university? Of course you're an expert!
If you're a student looking for a new job, make extra sure to include everything you have ever heard of! Seriously, I mean it!

This is your chance to shine and again, confuse your enemy,

# 5. Avoid customization for the company!

Doesn't matter where you apply - use exactly the same information!
Deciding what should go in is a hard work, and you don't have your own scrying ball, so make sure to include **EVERYTHING** everywhere.
Worked as a car mechanic, but applying now for IT company? Who cares, list all the details. Maybe one of those companies will have a need for this set of skills? You might miss out on an oppportunity!
Don't leave anything to chance.
They MUST know you are fabulous, and those darn recruiters have nothing better to do than to keep reading your CV anyway. 

Plus, you wouldn't want to waste your time tailoring that thing to a company. Your time is precious!
Let them read all of it and admire your extremely broad skill set!

# 6. Make your CV stand out!

ComicSans is your friend! 
In general, the fancier, the better!
Readability? Whatever, stun those recrutiers with your text editing skills!
Let me tell you a secret - yellow font color! Always works!
Show them who is the boss here, they will be at your feet!

# 7. Or hide in plain view.

If you think editing is too much work - you're right.
Your time is precious. 
Use serif font. 
No formatting.
No **bold**.
No *italics*.

Shh... If you don't feel like flooring them, hide in plain view.

# 8. One pager or an essay - nothing in between!

You have two possible approaches. Security through brevity or security through obscurity.
2 or 3 pages long CV will not attend to any of those. You need either 1 or 10 pages. 
This way you are sure to instill some respect in the recruiters. 

# 9. Interests section

They must know you are THE best person ever.
Make sure that your list has at least several positions.
Things like 'reading books', 'walking in the mountains with my dog' or 'watching movies in the cinema' will be perfectly fine. But - there's a catch: avoid anything even remotely related to your desired position! Keep it generic.
If you make it to the interview and they ask you about any of those, make sure to look hurt they asked. But you will handle it, after all those are all easy things to talk about.

If you are desperate for job, make sure to list that job as your hobby! It works wonders!

# 10. Last but not least: don't include summary section

You know this part on the very top, where in plain words, three sentences at most you say who you are, what you want and why you are here?

Avoid it at all cost!
First, it must be customized, so avoiding it saves your time.
Second, it would say too much and maybe reveal that you know what you want!
No, don't do this! Seriously, just don't!


# Final word

Now you are ready. Those are just a few simple advices on how to beat your enemy - the evil recruiter.
Good luck!

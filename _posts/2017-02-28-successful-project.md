What does it mean that project is successful? <br/>
Let's say that we delivered on time, on budget and per specifications. <br/>
Our code was perfect. Readable, testable, self-documenting. <br/>
Our solution was so intuitive that it could almost use itself. <br/>

And yet... Not a single user actually used it.  <br/>
Why? Because client said what they thought they needed, not what they really needed. <br/>
And they got what they asked for, not what they wanted. <br/>

It looks like if the client programmed us, their team.  <br/>
And we, being obedient, little robots, did what we were told... <br/>
...Wait, what? <br/>

Someone once said that the biggest problem in IT is the poor quality of the client.

I can't really agree. <br/> 
Think about it.  <br/>
People are - usually - rational agents. <br/>
They don't hire your team to waste money.  <br/>
They hire you to bring value. <br/>

There is however a big "but" to this:

Client does not always know what is really needed. <br/>
The problem domain is usually complex.  <br/>
Possible solutions are numerous, and each comes with its own set of trade-offs, pros and cons.

It's like buying a new pair of shoes. Unless you're one of the extremely lucky beings, it will usually take at least several attempts to find a pair that meets all requirements: fits well, looks good and cost is acceptable. You might need to decide for some trade-offs: cheaper, but will last shorter, awesome-looking, but you will suffer... You get the drift.

Your client is buying your time and skill to get something that will solve their problem. <br/>
And your project can be considered to be successfull only if that problem is solved. <br/>
If you can solve your client's problems, they will keep coming back for more good solutions. <br/>
If you can't, even if you deliver on time, on budget and per specifications, you still fail.
